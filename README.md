# JULIA

## Struggling to cook and follow your recipe? Tired of washing your hands repeatedly to scroll-up and down on your laptop? Julia is just what you need.

Julia is an online recipe book which operates through voice commands.

Simply start by saying 'Hey Julia help' to have an overview of all the possible commands.

Julia automatically displays your recipe one step at a time and she is able to read the relevant ingredients for the step, to read the instructions, to repeat, to go forward or backward - everything you need to focus on cooking, not fiddling with your laptop.
