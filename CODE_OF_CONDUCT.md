**Roles**

- Taskmaster - waffle scroller at stand-up
- Gitmaster - commits
- Testmaster - make sure test per process

### Daily process
- Morning stand-up started by yesterday's Taskmaster - New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster) Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)

- Pair program on assigned tasks

- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting

- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels

- At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge

- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master when applicable; pull from master at end of day no matter what; commit to feature branches no matter what.

### Team expectations

- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project.

- Optional night/weekend work; discuss with team what working on; only work on feature branches

- Mention preference for work task at stand-up

- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought

- If the issue is super blocking, text or call

- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)

- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code

- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand

- Share the mic

- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently

- At least message the group when you change what you are working on

- If you feel you don’t have enough work/are stuck for 30 minutes, slack the team

### Issues

- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
1. Take 10-15 minute break
2. List out the pros / cons
3. Vote on it
4. If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor

- If you are frustrated
1. Take a walk or get some water
2. Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
3. Communicate both party’s understanding of issue/topic and find common ground
4. Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
